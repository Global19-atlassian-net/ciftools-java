/**
 * <p>The instance of a parsed CifFile. No difference between binary and text files is exposed. This class does not
 * represent a parsed data model. Rather all source data is neatly wrapped into a type-safe hierarchy of {@link Block},
 * {@link Category}, and {@link Column} entities. Parsing (for text data) or decoding (for binary data) is only done,
 * when the content of particular categories or columns is requested. Otherwise the goal is to keep interaction with the
 * source data to a bare minimum: just enough to provide this view of the data model.</p>
 *
 * <p>CifFiles have the following hierarchy:</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>1 CifFile contains 1...n Blocks</li>
 *  <li>1 Block contains 1...n Categories</li>
 *  <li>1 Category contains 1...n Columns</li>
 *  <li>1 Column contains 1...n rows of raw values (int, double, or String)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Prominent Categories and Columns are provided in a type-safe manner based on the mmCIF dictionary. Missing categories
 * and columns will still be accessible, though the report being undefined and have a row count of 0. Most values in the
 * data structure will be available, but some are missing or unknown. This property of individual values is reported by
 * the {@link ValueKind} property of a {@link Column}.</p>
