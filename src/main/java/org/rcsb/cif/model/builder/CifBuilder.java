/**
 * Allows the creation of CifFile instances which were not read from some InputStream.
 *
 * The builder follows a stepwise approach (i.e. the builder does not always return itself, but rather several
 * subclasses provide builder-functions relevant in a specific context). The implementation represents the hierarchy of
 * a CifFile (file - block - category - column - data) by a D3-like approach: <code>enter</code> is used to move to a
 * more fine-grained level of information (e.g. file to block), while leave does the opposite.
 *
 * By following this approach, all elements are aware of their parent and all parents can process information from their
 * children appropriately. It is also possible to create builder instances for categories or columns directly, however
 * they need to be added explicitly by functions like {@link CategoryBuilder#addColumn(Column)}.
 *
 * As for many parts of this library, absolutely no checks are performed - e.g. the number of rows in columns connected
 * by a category can be different which will cause all sorts of issues. However, it is up to the user to ensure data
 * integrity.
